Low relief topography allows for subtle surface water divides and increases the likelihood that groundwater divides do not coincide with surface water divides. We investigate how groundwater transfer across subtle surface water divides facilitates channel network expansion using a numerical model built on the Landlab platform. Our model simulates surface and subsurface water routing and fluvial erosion. We consider two end-member scenarios for surface water routing, one in which surface water in closed depressions is forced to connect to basin outlets (routing) and one in which surface water in closed depressions is lost to evapotranspiration (no routing). Groundwater is modeled as fully saturated flow within a confined aquifer. Groundwater emerges as surface water where the landscape has eroded to a specified depth. We held the total water flux constant and varied the fraction of water introduced as groundwater versus precipitation. Channel growth is significantly faster in routing cases than no-routing cases given identical groundwater fractions. In both routing and no-routing cases, channel expansion is fastest when ~30% of the total water enters the system as groundwater. Groundwater contributions also produce distinctive morphology including steepened channel profiles below groundwater seeps. Groundwater head gradients evolve with topography and groundwater-fed channels can grow more quickly than channels with larger surface water catchments. We conclude that rates of channel network growth in low-relief post-glacial areas are sensitive to groundwater contributions. More broadly, our findings suggest that landscape evolution models may benefit from more detailed representation of hydrologic processes.","tags":[],"title":"Numerical modeling of groundwater‐driven stream network evolution in low‐relief post‐glacial landscapes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dr. Jingtao Lai","Alison M.

Over much of the Midwest, depositional glacial processes diminished pre-glacial relief by filling valleys and left constructional landforms including low-relief till plains and high relief moraines. As the ice retreated, meltwater collected in subglacial or proglacial lakes leaving fine-grained, sorted sediment in the form of glacial lake plains. Glacial lakes episodically drained in outburst floods, carving deep valleys.\nHowever, meltwater valleys did not provide a landscape-wide integrated drainage network. Instead, a significant fraction of the area of low-relief till plains and glacial lake plains was occupied by closed depressions and remained unconnected to external drainage networks. This area is referred to by hydrologists as non-contributing area (NCA) because it does not typically contribute surface runoff to stream networks. NCA becomes integrated into external drainage networks over time.\nHypothesis We propose that this integration could occur via at least two different paths:\n through capture of NCA as channel heads propagate into the upland or, through erosion of a channel along a flow path that, perhaps intermittently, connects NCA to the external drainage network.  We refer the two cases as “disconnected” and “connected” since the crucial difference between them is the hydrological connection of the upland to external drainage.\nMethod We investigate the difference in morphology and rate of growth of channel networks in low relief landscapes under disconnected and connected drainage regimes using numerical simulations of fluvial and hillslope processes.\nWe use the Landlab model platform to simulate the evolution of post-glacial landscapes, starting from a flat low-relief surface. The surface evolves via detachment-limited fluvial incision and hillslope diffusion.\nThe model is coupled with a new flow routing algorithm that represents upland connection by spillover of water from closed depressions. The modified version of Landlab is here.\nFindings  The growth of channel network is faster in the connected case than in the disconnected case. The channel network in the connected case has longer and more sinuous channels than the disconnected case. To accomplish the same degree of integration, the connected case removes less sediment than the disconnected case. Holding the volumes of water constant shows that the disconnected case is more efficient than the connected case at eroding for limited volumes of accumulated discharge.

The Boston Mountains, which define the southern margin of the Ozark Plateau and now reach an elevation of 780 m, consist of flat-lying late Paleozoic strata. They lie directly north of the Ouachita Mountains, an eroded remnant of a late Paleozoic fold-thrust belt. Elevations in the Ouachitas are generally lower than 500 m but locally rise to 840 m. The east-flowing Arkansas River defines the boundary between the two provinces. We propose that the flexural unloading by preferential erosion of the Ouachita fold-thrust belt contributed to the uplift of the Boston Mountains. Specifically, the contrast in resistance to erosion between relatively strong undeformed beds of sandstone and limestone in the Boston Mountains and highly fractured, relatively soft flysch of the Ouachita fold-thrust belt caused the Ouichitas to erode much more deeply than the Ozarks. Overall flexural rebound due to the erosion of the fold-thrust belt, has driven Cenozoic uplift of the entire region. The relatively strong strata of the Boston Mountains have remained high, relative to the Ouachitas. To test this hypothesis, we developed a group of numerical landscape evolution models using the Landlab modeling platform to test the effect of flexural unloading and erodability contrasts on the landscape evolution of an inactive orogen and its adjacent foreland basin. The fluvial erosion process is modeled using the stream power law. The relative weakness of rocks in the fold-thrust belt, due to their composition and fracturing, is simulated with an erodability coefficient in the stream power law. When the erodability coefficient of the orogen is five times as large as the foreland basin, the model predicts a high foreland basin and a low orogen, and the height contrast is comparable to the current topography of the Boston Mountains and the Ouachita Mountains. A factor of five difference in the erodability coefficient is reasonable given the difference in both lithology and structure that distinguishes the Boston Mountains from the Ouachitas.","tags":[],"title":"The influence of flexural unloading and rock fractures on landscape evolution at the boundary between a cratonic platform and an orogen: A case study of uplift in the southern Ozark Plateau","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dr. Jingtao Lai","Alison M.

Theoretical models link the rate of erosion by abrasion and quarrying to the rate of basal sliding, and numerical landscape evolution models typically assume that the erosion rate is proportional to the sliding velocity raised to some power. A careful treatment of basal sliding is therefore essential to model glacial erosion. The shallow ice approximation (SIA) scheme has been used to model ice flow in many numerical landscape evolution models, and these models rely on an empirical sliding law that relates sliding velocity to ice surface gradient. However, this sliding law lacks proper treatment of the stress balance of ice and it may produce unrealistic topography in glacial landscape evolution models. Furthermore, most previous models neglect the conservation of energy or use simplified models to solve the subglacial thermal state. The Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) uses a “hybrid” scheme that combines the shallow shelf approximation (SSA) with the non-sliding SIA. Basal sliding in PISM is modeled by the SSA stress balance and a pseudo-plastic till model for basal resistance, and PISM conserves energy. We conduct a series of numerical experiments using both the traditional SIA scheme and the hybrid scheme to model the glaciation and glacial erosion over a synthetic glacial landscape. Our results show a substantial difference in the spatial and temporal distribution of sliding velocity predicted by the two schemes. The traditional SIA method predicts more temporal variation of sliding rate than the hybrid scheme. The transition from non-sliding ice to sliding ice happens at higher elevation in the SIA scheme than the hybrid scheme. The hybrid scheme predicts realistic glacial landforms such as overdeepening of glacial valleys. Models using the traditional SIA method are prone to numerical instability.

Large-scale topographic analyses show an agreement between summit elevations along different mountain ranges and the equilibrium line altitude (ELA), and most glacial landscape evolution models suggest that glacial erosion is most efficient around and above the time mean ELA. In some high-latitude regions, however, mountains have attained elevations above the ELA and glacial erosion rates are presumed to be low because the ice is frozen to the bed.

We add a glacial erosion rule to PISM in which erosion is proportional to basal sliding. We conduct a group of numerical experiments to simulate the glaciation and glacial erosion over a synthetic mountain ridge. Model results show that a transition from frozen ice to sliding ice takes place as elevation decreases, and as a result, most glacial erosion occurs in valleys with little erosion at high elevations. Glacial erosion is greatest below ELA, and there is no strong spatial relationship between the ELA and the maximum erosion rate. We compare several cases with similar ELA but different precipitation rates and temperatures. The ice extent is very similar in these cases, but they predict significantly different glacial erosion rates. In a warm and wet climate, glacial erosion is faster than in a cold and dry climate. The transition from non-erosive, frozen ice to erosive, sliding ice occurs at higher elevation in a warm and wet climate.
