<p>I am recruiting a PhD student at the University of Glasgow to investigate the links between glacial valley morphology, sediment dynamics, and climate variations. The project will involve a combination of topographic analysis, numerical modeling, and machine learning approaches. This exciting project would be fully-funded through the <a href="https://iapetus2.ac.uk/">IAPETUS2 program</a>.</p>

<p>Please see this <a href="https://iapetus2.ac.uk/studentships/glacial-valleys-in-a-changing-climate-understanding-links-between-glacial-valley-morphology-sediment-dynamics-and-climate-variations/">webpage</a> for further details about the project.</p>

<p>The deadline to submit applications is <strong>3rd January 2025</strong>, and instructions on the application process are available <a href="https://iapetus2.ac.uk/how-to-apply/">here</a>. Please contact me at <a href="mailto:Jingtao.Lai@glasgow.ac.uk">Jingtao.Lai@glasgow.ac.uk</a> if you have any questions about the project. Note that <strong>international (non-UK) applicants must contact me by no later than 9th December 2024</strong> if they would like to be considered for sponsorship.</p>

<p>I am always happy to discuss potential PhD projects with students who have or intend to apply for external funding (China’s CSC Scholarship, for example). Please get in touch if you have a research idea related to the broad theme of interactions between climate and Earth surface processes.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Glacial valleys in a changing climate]]></summary></entry></feed>
