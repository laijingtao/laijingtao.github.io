### Glacial valleys in a changing climate

I am recruiting a PhD student at the University of Glasgow to investigate the links between glacial valley morphology, sediment dynamics, and climate variations. The project will involve a combination of topographic analysis, numerical modeling, and machine learning approaches. This exciting project would be fully-funded through the [IAPETUS2 program](https://iapetus2.ac.uk/).

Please see this [webpage](https://iapetus2.ac.uk/studentships/glacial-valleys-in-a-changing-climate-understanding-links-between-glacial-valley-morphology-sediment-dynamics-and-climate-variations/) for further details about the project.

The deadline to submit applications is __3rd January 2025__, and instructions on the application process are available [here](https://iapetus2.ac.uk/how-to-apply/). Please contact me at [Jingtao.Lai@glasgow.ac.uk](mailto:Jingtao.Lai@glasgow.ac.uk) if you have any questions about the project. Note that __international (non-UK) applicants must contact me by no later than 9th December 2024__ if they would like to be considered for sponsorship.

### Glacial erosion in the Patagonia Andes

Coming soon ... (expected online in mid December 2024)

### Other externally funded opportunities

I am always happy to discuss potential PhD projects with students who have or intend to apply for external funding (China's CSC Scholarship, for example). Please get in touch if you have a research idea related to the broad theme of interactions between climate and Earth surface processes.
