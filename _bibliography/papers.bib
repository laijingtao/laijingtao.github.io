  abstract  = {Climate has been viewed as a primary control on the rates and patterns of glacial erosion, yet our understanding of the mechanisms by which climate influences glacial erosion is limited. We hypothesize that climate controls the patterns of glacial erosion by altering the basal thermal regime of glaciers. The basal thermal regime is a first-order control on the spatial patterns of glacial erosion. Polythermal glaciers contain both cold- based portions that protect bedrock from erosion and warm-based portions that actively erode bedrock. In this study, we model the impact of various climatic conditions on glacier basal thermal regimes and patterns of glacial erosion in mountainous regions. We couple a sliding-dependent glacial erosion model with the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) to simulate the evolution of the glacier basal thermal regime and glacial erosion in a synthetic landscape. We find that both basal thermal regimes and glacial erosion patterns are sensitive to climatic conditions, and glacial erosion patterns follow the patterns of the basal thermal regime. Cold temperature leads to limited glacial erosion at high elevations due to cold-based conditions. Increasing precipitation can overcome the impact of cold temperature on the basal thermal regime by accumulating thick ice and lowering the melting point of ice at the base of glaciers. High precipitation rates, therefore, tend to cause warm-based conditions at high elevations, resulting in intensive erosion near the peak of the mountain range. Previous studies often assessed the impact of climate on the spatial patterns of glacial erosion by integrating climatic conditions into the equilibrium line altitudes (ELAs) of glaciers, and glacial erosion is suggested to be maximal around the ELA. However, our results show that different climatic conditions produce glaciers with similar ELAs but different patterns of basal thermal regime and glacial erosion, suggesting that there might not be any direct correlation between ELAs and glacial erosion patterns.},

  abstract  = {Glacial erosion has shaped many mountain belts during the cold periods of the Late Cenozoic. The rate of glacial erosion is sensitive to the subglacial environment, including both the subglacial hydrology and the basal thermal regime. Geothermal heat from underlying bedrock is a major contributor to glacier energy budgets, controlling ice dynamics at the ice-bed interface by changing the basal temperature and the supply of meltwater. Despite the known influence of geothermal heat on the subglacial environment, its impact on glacial erosion has received little study. The geothermal heat flux in glaciated mountain ranges varies widely as a function of the tectonic setting. Therefore, if glacial erosion is sensitive to geothermal heat flux, the evolution of glaciated landscapes may depend upon tectonically-controlled geothermal gradients. We explore the impact of geothermal heat flux on the rates and spatial patterns of glacial erosion in mountain ranges using numerical models. We couple a sliding-dependent glacial erosion model with the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) to simulate the evolution of a synthetic glacial landscape. We find a robust tendency for increasing glacial erosion with increasing geothermal heat flux. The spatial pattern of erosion also varies with the magnitude of geothermal heat flux. At low geothermal heat flux, glacial erosion is consistently focused in major valleys. As geothermal heat flux increases, the area of significant glacial erosion expands into higher elevations and the rate of erosion increases. The location of maximum erosion migrates up-valley as geothermal heat flux increases, suggesting that glacial erosion tends to produce distinct landscapes as a function of geothermal heat flux. Our finding suggests that active mountain belts with high geothermal heat flux will express the glacial buzzsaw effect, in which high elevation topography is preferentially removed by glacial erosion. Glaciers at passive margins with low geothermal heat flux, in contrast, will tend to incise deep valleys at relatively low elevations. Previous work on the interaction between tectonics and landscape evolution has focused on relief generation and fracturing of rocks. Our results introduce a novel potential linkage between tectonics and erosion based on the sensitivity of glacial erosion to geothermal heat.},

  abstract  = {Landscapes of the U.S. Central Lowland were repeatedly affected by the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Glacial processes diminished relief and disrupted drainage networks. Deep valleys carved by meltwater were disconnected from the surrounding uplands. The upland area lacking surface water connection to the drainage network is referred to as noncontributing area (NCA). Decreasing fractions of NCA on older surfaces suggest that NCA becomes drained over time. We propose that the integration could occur via (1) capture of NCA as channels propagate into the upland or (2) subsurface or intermittent surface connection of NCA to external drainage networks providing increased discharge to promote channel incision. We refer the two cases as “disconnected” and “connected” since the crucial difference between them is the hydrological connection of the upland to external drainage. We investigate the differences in evolution and morphology of channel networks in low-relief landscapes under disconnected and connected regimes using numerical simulations. We observe substantially faster rates of erosion and integration of the channel network in the connected case. The connected case also creates longer, more sinuous channels than the disconnected case. Sensitivity tests indicate that hillslope diffusivity has little influence on the evolution and morphology. The fluvial erosion coefficient has significant impact on the rate of evolution, and it influences the morphology to a lesser extent. Our results and a qualitative comparison with landscapes of the glaciated U.S. Central Lowland suggest that connection of NCAs is a potential control on the evolution and morphology of postglacial landscapes.},

@article{Anders2022,
  abstract  = {Unlike well-known plateaus associated with Cenozoic orogens, the Appalachian and Ozark Plateaus of the eastern United States fringe the foreland side of a long inactive and deeply eroded orogen. These foreland intracratonic plateaus (FIPs), which are underlain by sub-horizontal cratonic-platform strata and, in places, foreland-basin strata, now lie 0.5–1.2 km above sea level, notably higher than adjacent fold-thrust belts. An escarpment lies at or near the boundary between the FIPs and the fold-thrust belts. Why did the topographic inversion leading to the development of the FIPs take place? To address this question, we built a numerical model, using Landlab, to simulate how topography evolves as foreland lithosphere flexes upward when post-tectonic erosion causes unloading. In this model, flat-lying cap-rock strata (sandstone and limestone) of the foreland have greater resistance to erosion than do the deformed, tilted, cleaved, and fractured strata of the fold-thrust belt, especially where the fold-thrust belt contains argillaceous facies. We tested the model by characterizing the development of the Ozark Plateau in the foreland of the Ouachita fold-thrust belt. Results demonstrate that regional isostatic uplift due to erosion, given reasonable differences in resistance to erosion between the fold-thrust belt and the foreland, can generate the observed topographic inversion and a distinct escarpment, yielding a plateau. This model may help explain the post-Paleozoic evolution of the Catskill Mountains, the Deep Valleys Province, and the Cumberland Plateau, highlands which border the Appalachian fold-thrust belt.},

  abstractnote = {Fold-and-thrust belts (FTBs) develop widely in and around active orogenic belts on Earth. With the accumulation of structural shortening, thrust-related folds can grow by increasing their amplitudes and lengths, providing insights into the structural evolution of FTBs. Investigations of fold growth patterns and landscape responses through time and space have important implications for hydrocarbon exploration and geo-hazard assessment. Evidence for lateral fold propagation (i.e., increase in length) usually comes from geochronological constraints based on differences in onset timings along strike. However, these traditional methods are time consuming and economically costly. Alternatively, previous studies have proposed the use of geomorphic features to investigate the lateral fold propagation, including spatial variations in the patterns and densities of river channels, the configuration of the topographic profile along the fold crest, and the occurrence of wind gaps. However, such analyses are based on morphological features of present-day landscapes, which still need process-based validations. Here, we conduct a series of landscape evolution models to reproduce fold growth and their associated geomorphic adjustments. Our results show that deflected rivers and inflected fold-crest elevation profile with decreasing gradient are reliable evidence of lateral fold propagation. The location of propagation is in accordance with the distribution of crest-profile slope breaks and the position where river deflection began. Then, we apply these findings to two natural examples located at the deformation fronts of the Tian Shan (NW China). Results suggest that 1) the Kashi anticline has experienced lateral propagation both westwards and eastwards; and 2) that the Yaken anticline has experienced accelerated tectonic uplift as well as eastwards propagation. These findings are supported by the constraints from geochronological dating and quantitative structural analysis. Future work that integrates folding mechanisms may provide novel insights into landscape response to complex deformation in active FTBs.},
