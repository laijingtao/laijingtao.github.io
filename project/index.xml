      <description>Background The relationship between late Cenozoic cooling and the dynamics of mountain building has been in debate for decades, and glacial erosion is a critical component that links climate to tectonic deformation. Glaciers may limit the height of mountain ranges through an efficient denudation mechanism known as “glacial buzzsaw”. This theory is supported by a correlation between the equilibrium line altitudes (ELA) and maximum height of mountain ranges. However, the correlation between ELA and mountain heights breaks down in high-latitude regions, where mountain peaks attain elevations above the ELA of Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and erosion is slower than mid-latitude regions.</description>

      <description>Background Landscapes of the US Midwest were repeatedly affected by the southernmost portions of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the Quaternary. Over much of the Midwest, depositional glacial processes diminished pre-glacial relief by filling valleys and left constructional landforms including low-relief till plains and high relief moraines. As the ice retreated, meltwater collected in subglacial or proglacial lakes leaving fine-grained, sorted sediment in the form of glacial lake plains. Glacial lakes episodically drained in outburst floods, carving deep valleys.</description>
