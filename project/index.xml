      <description>Climate plays a significant role in controlling the evolution of alpine landscapes by influencing the rate and pattern of alpine glacier erosion. The equilibrium line altitude (ELA) is a common way to collapse climate into a single variable. The ELA is an integration of various factors controlling glacial mass balance and the position of the ELA is largely controlled by local temperature and snowfall rates. The location of the most rapid erosion is suggested to coincide with the intersection of the ELA and topography because the efficiency of glacial erosion is often assumed to be highest where the ice flux is at the maximum.</description>

      <description>Background Landscapes of the US Midwest were repeatedly affected by the southernmost portions of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the Quaternary. Over much of the Midwest, depositional glacial processes diminished pre-glacial relief by filling valleys and left constructional landforms including low-relief till plains and high relief moraines. As the ice retreated, meltwater collected in subglacial or proglacial lakes leaving fine-grained, sorted sediment in the form of glacial lake plains. Glacial lakes episodically drained in outburst floods, carving deep valleys.</description>
