Glacial erosion has shaped many mountain ranges during the Late Cenozoic glaciation. To understand the controls of tectonics and climate on glacial erosion, Iâ€™ve developed a numerical landscape evolution model that I couple with a thermomechanically coupled ice sheet model to examine the sensitivities of glacier dynamics and glacial erosion to various tectonic and climatic conditions. Using this model, I investigate the response of glacial erosion to increased geothermal heat flow. The model reveals a tendency for increased glacial erosion with increasing geothermal heat flow, suggesting a novel interaction between tectonics and glacial erosion: tectonics may accelerate glacial erosion by elevating geothermal heat (Lai and Anders, 2020, _EPSL_). I also investigate the impact of climate on the patterns and rates of glacial erosion. This research suggests that climate controls glacial erosion primarily through the basal thermal regime and glacial erosion tends to be maximized at the transition between cold-based and warm-based ice. This finding challenges the traditional view that glacial erosion is greatest at the intersection between bedrock topography and the equilibrium line altitudes of glaciers.
