      <description>Background The relationship between late Cenozoic cooling and the dynamics of mountain building has been in debate for decades, and glacial erosion is a critical component that links climate to tectonic deformation. Glaciers may limit the height of mountain ranges through an efficient denudation mechanism known as “glacial buzzsaw”. This theory is supported by a correlation between the equilibrium line altitudes (ELA) and maximum height of mountain ranges. However, the correlation between ELA and mountain heights breaks down in high-latitude regions, where mountain peaks attain elevations above the ELA of Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and erosion is slower than mid-latitude regions.</description>
