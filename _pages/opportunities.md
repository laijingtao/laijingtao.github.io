### Glacial valleys in a changing climate

I am recruiting a PhD student at the University of Glasgow to investigate the links between glacial valley morphology, sediment dynamics, and climate variations. The project will involve a combination of topographic analysis, numerical modeling, and machine learning approaches. This exciting project would be fully-funded through the [IAPETUS2 program](https://iapetus2.ac.uk/).

Please see this [webpage](https://iapetus2.ac.uk/studentships/glacial-valleys-in-a-changing-climate-understanding-links-between-glacial-valley-morphology-sediment-dynamics-and-climate-variations/) for further details about the project.

The deadline to submit applications is __3rd January 2025__, and instructions on the application process are available [here](https://iapetus2.ac.uk/how-to-apply/). Please contact me at [Jingtao.Lai@glasgow.ac.uk](mailto:Jingtao.Lai@glasgow.ac.uk) if you have any questions about the project. Note that __international (non-UK) applicants must contact me by no later than 9th December 2024__ if they would like to be considered for sponsorship.

### GPU-accelerated Earth surface process modeling

I am involved in several projects focusing on developing new GPU-accelerated models for Earth surface processes, as part of the [ExaGEO](https://www.exageo.org/) program. You can find more details by searching my name or the following project titles on [this page](https://www.exageo.org/phd-student-projects/):

- Pace and style of glacial erosion in the Patagonian Andes (lead supervisor)
- Investigate the response of proglacial fluvial systems to glacier retreat using GPU-accelerated numerical simulations (co-supervisor)
- GPU-accelerated multiscale modelling for glacier sliding (co-supervisor)
- Earth system twin for landscape evolution processes (co-supervisor)
- Earth system twin for landslides along UK coasts with soil-rock mixtures (co-supervisor)

The deadline to submit applications is __17rd February 2025__, and instructions on the application process are available [here](https://www.exageo.org/apply/). Please contact me at [Jingtao.Lai@glasgow.ac.uk](mailto:Jingtao.Lai@glasgow.ac.uk) if you have any questions.

### College Scholarship at the University of Glasgow

The School of Geographical and Earth Sciences offers two College PhD Scholarships to begin in October 2025. Please see this [link](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/ges/research/postgraduate/#phdopportunities%3Acollegescholarships(geographical%26earthsciences)) for further details about the scholarship, and I am happy to discuss potential PhD projects with students who intend to apply.

### Other externally funded opportunities

I am always happy to discuss potential PhD projects with students who have or intend to apply for external funding (China's CSC Scholarship, for example). Please get in touch if you have a research idea related to the broad theme of interactions between climate and Earth surface processes.
