I'm currently a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow based at the GFZ Potsdam, in the [Earth Surface Process Modelling section](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/section/earth-surface-process-modelling/overview/).

My research interests center around the interactions between climate, tectonics, and surface processes and their impacts on landscape evolution.

My approach thus far has been to develop numerical landscape evolution models to explore the sensitivity of landscape characteristics to variability in climate, surface process regime, and tectonics.
