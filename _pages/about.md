I am an Earth scientist focused on studying the interactions between climate and Earth’s topography. I work as a Research Scientist in the [School of Geographical and Earth Sciences](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/ges/) at the University of Glasgow.

I received my Ph.D. in Geology from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2020 and my B.Sc. in Geology from Peking University in 2015. Prior to moving to Glasgow, I was a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow/Postdoctoral Researcher at the GFZ Potsdam.

My research examines the evolution of Earth’s topography and how it interacts with climate and solid Earth. I combine numerical models with observational data to quantify the rates and patterns of landscape evolution. I am particularly interested in characterizing how glaciers and rivers change Earth’s topography during glacial-interglacial cycles.

**Prospective collaboration & Ph.D. students**: please feel free to contact me via email for any collaboration, discussion of ideas, or [Ph.D. opportunities](/opportunities/).
