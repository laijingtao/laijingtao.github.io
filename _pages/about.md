I am a geomorphologist studying the interactions between climate and Earth’s topography.
I'm currently a Postdoctoral Researcher based at the GFZ Potsdam, in the [Earth Surface Process Modelling section](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/section/earth-surface-process-modelling/overview/).

I received my Ph.D. in Geology from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2020 and my B.Sc. in Geology from Peking University in 2015.

My research examines the evolution of Earth’s topography and how it interacts with climate and solid Earth. I combine numerical models with observational data to quantify the rates and patterns of landscape evolution. I am particularly interested in characterizing how glaciers and rivers change Earth’s topography during glacial-interglacial cycles.
